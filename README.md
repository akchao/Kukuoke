# Kukuoke
Team: Alice Chao, Felix Kejin Fan, Olivia Woo, Yuduo Zhao

Made for Penn Apps XVII. This is a native Android app that lets the user keep and share karaoke lists organized by singing competency level.

The name "Kukuoke" is a portmanteau of the words "karaoke" and "kuku", which means chicken in Swahili. We like that our rooster mascot embodies the colorful, flamboyant, and confident zeitgeist of the 80s, which suited the "retro" theme of the hackathon well. 

We did not use any external graphical assets to make this app. Thanks to our talented teammate Olivia, we were able to get our own amazing logo, icons, and illustrations!

**Please note that because this app was made in the span of 36 hours, the code may not be well documented or clean, and not all features work perfectly.** That being said, bear with us, and enjoy the pretty pictures! :)

The user is able to create their own account connected to Google Firebase. Each user is assigned a unique ID (blurred out in the second picture, below the email) which can be used to befriend other users of this app. (Feature WIP)

The main feature of the app allows the user to store their karaoke songs in three different lists: the "got this" list contains songs the user is good at singing; the "maybe" list contains songs that the user likes but haven't tried; the "nope" list contains songs that the user has bombed in the past - so stay away from them if you're trying to impress a date on karaoke night!

Songs can be added via an "add song" page which searches thru Last.fm's song catalog.

All users who are friends with one another on this app are able to find songs they have in common with one another. This can be used to suggest duet songs between friends on karaoke night! (Feature WIP)
